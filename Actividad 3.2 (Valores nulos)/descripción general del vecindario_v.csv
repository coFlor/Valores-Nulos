But the real interest lies in its people, here lives the traditional and authentic Valencian people, and that has a translation in gastronomy. Ladies queuing at the fishmonger's, gentlemen picking up the bread bar in charge, and bars, lots of bars. It is a lively neighborhood, in permanent boil. <br /><br />In J.M. Bar Restaurant at noon they serve dishes of lentils and at night it is tapas, from fried fish, to trays of seafood that remove the hiccups. They shop at the fish market across the street. <br /><br />Put to talk about tapas, it is also worth mentioning Taberna Fabianos. About twenty years  that continue to serve the same: spoon and tapas of good customs: a Madrid cooked day, another arÃ³s with beans and naps, that if Manchego gazpacho and, of course, Valencian paella.

There's a lot to see the powerful and delicate presence of that Botanical Garden, which serves as an oasis for tourists and a haven for lovers. A few Valencians remembered that behind the walls of Calle Quart stands a vergel that has witnessed the history of the city more than five centuries ago. That's why a tour of the neighborhood, and its countless restaurants and bars, can start, or end, with a stroll through these gardens.  Crossing the access door to the Botanic is like entering Fantasia or Narnia. Check it out."
